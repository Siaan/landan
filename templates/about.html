  <h2> <font color = "white">About our Team</font></h2>
</center>
  <p> <font color = "white">(Ph)omo is inspired by the common abbreviation that those silly Americans use, FOMO. It stands for a fear of missing out. As prancing Americans in London, we realized that all we wanted to do was to take photos. However, we could not imagine not getting the best photos at the best locations. Among our team, we had two especially precocious photographers who busily snapped away as we traveled through London. Now imagine if there was a platform for amateur and professional photographers to discover the best locations to take photos. No one would like to miss out on that huh?! This idea was adapted based on similar idea taken from a previous hack, but stuffed with brand new technology we all had a blast learning. </font>
